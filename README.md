### <h3>Hello Everyone! My name is Kevin Carvajal ðŸ‘‹ <h3>

I am currently learning how to code at Triple Ten. Once I am done with this bootcamp I am looking forward to working for a tech company as a software engineer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Fullstack
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone to better my skills as a developer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: During my free time I like to play video games, flag football, basketball, and hangout with my family and friends.
